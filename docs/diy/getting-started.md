To build a WiFi Duck yourself, you need the following hardware:  
* An Atmega32u4 development board (see the list below)  
* An ESP8266 or ESP8285 development board (see the list below)  
* Optional: A single Neopixel (WS2812b) or Dotstar (APA102) LED

To flash the microcontrollers you need a computer and USB cable.  

If you're a beginner, it's recommended you wire everything together on a breadboard first!  
In this case, you'd also need a breadboard with a couple of jumper wires.  

If you wish to solder everything together into a small gadget,
you also need soldering equipment.  

You can use any Atmega32u4 or ESP8266 based development board,
but if you have no idea where to start, here's a list.  
:warning: **Keep in mind that you will need both microcontrollers!**  
The Atmega32u4 to act as USB keyboard, and the ESP8266 for WiFi.

### Atmega32u4 Development Boards
* Arduino Leonardo
* Arduino Micro
* Sparkfun Pro Micro
