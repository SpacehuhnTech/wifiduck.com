## What you need
* An Atmega32u4 development board (see the list below)  
* An ESP8266 or ESP8285 development board (see the list below)  
* (Optional: A single Neopixel (WS2812b) or Dotstar (APA102) LED)

To flash the microcontrollers, you need a computer and USB cable.  
And if you want to solder it together into a small gadget, you also need soldering equipment. 

:::tip
If you're a beginner, it's recommended you wire everything together on a breadboard first!  
In this case, you'd also need a breadboard with a couple of jumper wires.
