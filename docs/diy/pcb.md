### PCB

To make the DIY process easier, I designed a little PCB.  

You solder a Pro Micro board on one side and a Wemos d1 mini or NodeMCU board (depending on the PCB) on the other side.  
That's it. You don't even have to solder all pins,
just the ones mentioned in [Connections](/connections), excluding the LED.
