By emulating a USB keyboard, tools like this can gain full access to any computer with a USB port in a matter of seconds!
This is made possible by the fact that keyboards are trusted by computers. You can have full control over a computer with just a keyboard.
A BadUSB pretends to be a keyboard to the computer to send keystrokes. But unlike a human, it can type hundreds of characters per second. By using a simple scripting language, it's easy to make BadUSBs type whatever you want.
