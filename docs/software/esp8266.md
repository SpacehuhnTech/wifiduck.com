## Instructions

1. Open `esp_duck/esp_duck.ino` with the Arduino IDE
2. Under `Tools` > `Board` in the `WiFi Duck ESP8266` section, select your board. For example `NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)`.
3. Connect the ESP8266 board via USB and select its port under `Tools` > `Port`
5. Press Upload

:::info
After the first installation, the ESP8266 has to format its memory. So it might take a minute until it's fully operational.

:::tip
If you want to update the ESP8266 WiFi Duck, you can do that over the air!  
Connect to the `wifiduck` network (the default password is `wifiduck`). Then in Arduino at `Tools` > `Port`, you should now see a network port. Select it and press `Upload`.
