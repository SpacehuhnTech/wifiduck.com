### Flash ESP8266

1. Open `esp_duck/esp_duck.ino` with the Arduino IDE.
2. Under `Tools` > `Board` in the `WiFi Duck ESP8266` section, select your board.
For example `NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)`.
3. Connect the ESP8266 board via USB and select its port under `Tools` > `Port`.
5. Press Upload.

**Pro Tip:** If the ESP8266 is already running this software
and you just want to update it, you don't have to connect it via USB.
You can update it over the air! Simply connect to the `wifiduck` network (default password is `wifiduck`).  
Then in Arduino at `Tools` > `Port` you should now see a network port.
Select it and press `Upload`.  

**Note:** After the initial flashing, the ESP8266 has to format its memory, so it might take a minute until it's fully ready.  

If you connected the RGB LED:
* Blue LED = Connection working
* Green LED = Device ready
